\\ I did get lost on a couple things somehow, but lots of googling and using w3schools website was helpful.
\\ I found a lot of errors within my css file. I didnt find as many in this html file but im sure i missed something.
\\ Like, a bunch of extra ), and had a lot of empty lines. Thanks for your feedback, If im totally missing stuff feel free
\\ to be brutally honest, ive got pretty thick skin. I should have went back
\\ over and checked, somehow I did not as I spend friday about 7 hours and saturday all day working on this and combing
\\ through other helpful videos and resources. Im hoping to get much more accurate. will devote extra time to proofing this weeks assignment.
